## the unified_AD_loci_xQTL_summary.xlxs table	
Each row correspond to a variant in a locus that have been associated to AD GWAS (Combining finemaping and Coloc results for the 4 GWAS studies data used). 	

For each AD locus, only the variants with maximum GWAS PIP/VCP ('inclusion score') >0.1 are included, and we take only the top5 based on GWAS PIP/VCP + the top5 based on cV2F score. If no variant with inclusion score>0.1, only the top1 variant of GWAS PIP/VCP, xQTL PIP/VCP and cV2F score  is displayed.  

If the variant have been associated to an xQTL, summary are shown in xQTLs summary part.	 

Contexts are ordered and green colored according to a confidence score (C1 / darkgreen is best, C6/light green is lowest confidence) which combined TWAS, MR, finemapping and coloc results:	 
- C1: the gene is MR or cTWAS significant, the variant is in a CS95% overlapping between the GWAS and the xQTL (from single context finemapping)
- C2: the gene is MR or cTWAS significant, the variant is colocalizing (using colocboost) between the GWAS and the xQTL
- C3: the gene is TWAS significant, and the variant is colocalizing or in  CS95% overlapping between the GWAS and the xQTL
- C4: the variant is in a CS95% overlapping between the GWAS and the xQTL (from single context finemapping)
- C5: the variant is colocalizing or overlapping with any xQTL CS (multicontext, cs50, cs70..)
- C6:  the gene is TWAS significant only

TWAS significant: having TWAS pvalue <2.5e-6for the best method OR for more than 50% of the methods
MR significant: being TWAS significant + having cpip>0.5 & num_CS >=2& I2<0.5
cTWAS significant: the xQTL explain the GWAS zscore with pip > 0.75

The '+' or '-' after the context name correspond to the direction of the effect on the gene/molecular trait observed in finemapping (first '+/-') or in colocboost (second '+/-'). 
'Effect' column correspond to the effect on the molecular traits,
